# voice-assistant-mini
A voice-based technique that
allows farmers to raise questions and receive
interactive voice assistance concerning general
inquiries. This is commonly known as a
"conversational chatbot". AI-powered voice
assistants are able to identify human speech and
answer with synthetic voices. Several wellknown and widely used answering systems
include Apple's SIRI, Microsoft's Cortana,
IBM's Watson and Google's Alexa.
Conversational chatbots, a unique kind of userfriendly responding technology, are in high
demand in the agricultural industry. The
conversational bot web application is created as
part of the proposed system to help farmers.
Farmers will improve their farming techniques,
boost agricultural output, and receive crop
forecast assistance by using this application.
The system analyzes user queries using Natural
Language Processing to find keywords,
compares them to the Knowledge Base, and
provides precise responses. Classification
algorithms are used to generate non-textual
responses that consumers interpret
easily, making the responses more
comprehensible.
